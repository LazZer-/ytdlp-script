# ytdlp-script
a quick and dirty bash script for ytdlp to avoid typing or copying commands
fairly straightforward, give a yt link, decide if you want audio only, if not then choose if you want default options (best quality) or specific data stream, pick a custom path if you want, then it does the work. obviously you need [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for this, slam it alongside the script and i think it should work.
